This files describes all the optimizations ideas we left out for now.

- [block_tree]: track whether a block is ever broken to (explicitly or
  implictly), so that we know if anything after it is dead code to be
  removed. Dead code removal translates to less data dependency in the
  DAG, which translates to possibly less data copies in the final code.
  But there shouldn't be any already, if the WASM is from an optimizing
  compiler.

- [locals_data_flow]: track locals permutation. If some locals are read into
  a block, but in the end they are just output unmodified (either on stack
  or on some local), this can be resolved statically when building the DAG,
  eliding copies.

- [locals_data_flow]: sometimes a loop needs to take locals as inputs
  just to output them in certain breaks, unmodified. Such locals would
  have to be copied over through all the iterations, but never actually
  used inside the loop. In such cases, it is worth to make these breaks
  indirect, by creating blocks surrounding the loop just to forward the
  breaks. The passthrough locals will be handled by the outside blocks
  and breaks, avoiding them to be copied into the loop.

- [register_allocation]: also perform optimistic allocation on the nodes
  that generates outputs to returns in the top-level frame, because they
  are local frame writes like any local break.

- [register_allocation]: the register allocation is not perfectly optimal,
  it just uses a greedy approach to assign registers, and give up when it
  detects a conflict. It may be possible to model the problem to a SAT
  solver or something like that.

- if there are more than one loop nested inside each other, and the inner
  loop falls through the outer loop, which then breaks or falls through
  again, it is better to have the inner loop break directly to the final
  destination instead of going through multiple frame barriers, because
  each frame barrier potentially adds multiple copies.
