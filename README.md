# WOMIR - Write Once Memory IR

WOMIR is a compiler from [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) to an IR that flattens stack and locals into abstract infinite registers, with the goal of optimizing local accesses in VMs that can benefit such knowledge, especially zkVMs. The IR does not have a DSL and is represented only in a Rust library.

WOMIR is designed for optimal compilation to [PetraVM](https://github.com/PetraProver/PetraVM), developed through a collaboration between [powdr](https://www.powdr.org/) and [Irreducible](https://www.irreducible.com/).

## Targets

The IR can target any ISA that supports the usual MIPS/RISC-V style instructions and has RAM. ISAs that have a write once memory region may benefit heavily from infinite registers. This is especially true for zkVMs.

Under development:

## Interpreter

WOMIR has an [interpreter](https://github.com/powdr-labs/womir/blob/main/src/interpreter.rs) that is used for testing.
